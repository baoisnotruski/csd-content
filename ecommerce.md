### Overview

We have built web platforms to help business owners overcome the limitations of a physical store. These limitations include location, operation time, and overhead costs of a brick-and-mortar store. Selling online does come with challenges.

### Challenge

On the user interface side, an ecommerce website should have search functionality, responsive design, and high quality images. To increase likelihood of sales, new and repeat, a few features like user-generated reviews, related items, and social proof should be present as well. All of these, of course, should be combined with security features and seamless, multi-opion payment processes.

Ecommerce websites require the most features. The challenge is to create a website that has all these features, while maintaining a smooth and intuitive feel of the online shopping process.

### Solution

We combine creativity, clean architecture, and marketing insights to come up with an online selling platform that is robust under the hood and pleasant to use on the interface.
