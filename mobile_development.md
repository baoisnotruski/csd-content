### Overview

People move across different devices and platforms as they go through their day. The most accessible device today, without a doubt, is the mobile phone. We build web apps that work on different screens and operating systems; with functionality and designs that shift user trends.


### The Challenge

The future of mobile apps: simple interface, multiple functionalities, and low learning curves. The challenge is to bring all these seemingly conflicting elements together. How does one design a mobile app that provides users with all the functionalities they need while keeping the layout intuitive?


### The Solution

We combine front-end and back-end technologies to design user experience (UX). UX is something that can be defined in every quality line of code and each choice of pixel combination. We bring together disciplined code architecture, innovative technology, and customer feedback. We create and redesign products to meet new market concepts and customer needs.

### Case Study

Client: `Hireplicity`

`Hireplicity` needed a mobile platform that can keep up with the dynamic lifestyle of employers and job seekers. The brand recognized that job seekers and employers make meaningful decisions in coffee shops, office lounges, and many random places where they are with their mobile phones.

As `Hireplicity` is a full-feature recruitment and job-seeking service, their mobile app needed to accommodate a massive list of features. Our development team designed a simple layout with assumptions on how users will use the app.

We verified these assummptions with user tests and tweaked the app where needed. The result is a small-screen experience that paralleled the full desktop browser version.
