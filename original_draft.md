Mobile Application Development

New Window
Build beautiful and functional mobile applications to keep up with the growing trend of customers shifting to mobile transactions.
Why build Mobile Applications
Going mobile is becoming a smart business strategy. With millions of people using their mobile phones to complete a transaction, it’s becoming necessary to build a presence there. But the mobile applications market has also become saturated making it extra challenging to enter that sphere.
Mobile development companies will help you navigate that sphere by building a mobile app that’s functional and efficient. Partnering with the right mobile development company will accelerate the growth trajectory of your business.
But not every mobile development company can give you the right formula for success. After all, it’s not just about building the mobile app that you think gets the job done. You need to choose the right partner to help you see another perspective, tell you what’s right and what’s not, and provide technically-sound suggestions that contribute to overall business success.
The Hireplicity Advantage
With our solid background in mobile application development paired with our unique business insights from having worked with and helped companies grow, Hireplicity is the right partner for building compelling mobile apps both for native and cross-platform environments.
We provide end to end service - from planning to launching your mobile app in Google Playstore or in iTunes. We also provide free project management services to make sure that you are on pace and within your budget.

eCommerce
wooCommerce,
New Window
The right eCommerce site can turn your business from breaking even to profitable.
Why build an eCommerce site?
Online transactions are convenient and customers are looking for more and more convenient ways to purchase. Building your own eCommerce site will significantly scale your business without spending on capital. With a robust eCommerce site, you will also be able to reach a significant number of customers who are online and are ready to purchase. 
A custom eCommerce solution will help you achieve higher return on investment. The key is in making sure it is able to effectively handle a high volume of traffic and transactions. An eCommerce site that continually crashes will push potential customers away.
The Hireplicity Advantage
Hireplicity custom builds your eCommerce site. With our experience in developing complex systems, we will help you build an optimal eCommerce site that’s not only attentive to the needs of your customers, but also scalable to prepare you for growth.
Our dedicated software consultant and software development team will see to it that your project gets finished on time and according to how you envisioned it. You will be able to launch your eCommerce system within the agreed timeline.

Testing before launching your software is a crucial step in ensuring software is bug-free.
Why do Manual Testing?
Nothing can be more disappointing to your users than receiving a new version of software that is full of defects. QA testing is a necessary process that ensures a delightful experience.
This is mission-critical given that you only get one impression to your end-users. Your software development team will check and validate your software if it meets the technical and design requirements.
The Hireplicity Advantage
Our Software QA Engineers are experts in manual testing. On top of this, we encourage and support them to keep themselves updated on the latest technology and best practices in software testing. This helps them stay up to date and are able to continually provide the required expertise in the field. 
Automated Testing
Software Testing that’s fast and efficient.

The Hireplicity Advantage
Our Software QA Engineers are well-versed in both manual testing and automated testing. Depending on the requirements of the project, our QA Engineers utilize the best methods to achieve the best outcome.
