## Web Development

Over the years, we have developed web applications for enterprise-size organizations and SMEs. Businesses have used our web apps as platform to acquire new customers and get existing customers to keep coming back. 

### Challenge

The main challenge of establishing a web identity is to stand out. There is also a challenge to balance functionality and load speed. Users also need to experience a design that is intuitive enough that they do not need to search for a user guide.


### Our solution

Clean code is the foundation of everything we do. We write code in a way that allows for our web apps to meet user demands, scale up to new goals, and catch up with industry trends.

We design our user interface to minimize on-boarding time, the time it takes for users to understand how our web app works. Understanding how users use our web apps is essential to making intuitive design possible. We achieve this by combining our cleints' input with the knowledge we gained over the years as a top-notch web app development company.

### Case Study

Client: `Hireplicity`

Hireplicity is a talent acquisition platform that performs a 360-degree role. It houses its own web development talent and curates a database of tech specialists. It is equipped with a recruitment tracking tool that covers every aspect of the hiring process for both job searchers and employers.

`Hireplicity` has a massive ambition. We clustered the components of this ambitious aim into microservices that work harmoniously as a whole. The result is a web platform that can do more with minimal resources -- in lay person's term: a smooth browsing experience.

We also implemented the UX equivalent of empty space. Employers and job seekers accomplish their goals on the `Hireplicity` website with the least amount of mouse clicks and keyboard touches as possible.
