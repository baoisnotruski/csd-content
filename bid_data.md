We have been taking the steps to combine our experiences and expertise with big data. Being able to use massive chunks of information gives us the ability to make smarter decisions and better-informed design thinking. 


## The challenge

Online data is massive. The first challenge is build or find tools that make data collection efficient -- making machines do stuff that machines should do. 

Big data, by its nature, is unstructed. The next challenge is to turn massive amounts of information into meaningful insights: insights that define where we put headers on a web page, what colors we want to use for mobile apps, and where we put the purchase button. The small decisions that we make are informed by big data. 

### The solution

The challenges we encounter define pathways to the solutions we make. We use big data to create code so that the time users spend on the mobile and web apps that we build become meaningful experiences. 

We utilize tools for large-scale data processing to distill meaningful insights. This allows us to take on experimental projects as if we have already been there before.
