### The Challenge

Being a nuanced blend of business models, customers, and context, each business faces a unique set of challenges. A generic software suite often falls short in filling all the gaps presented by business problems.

### The Solution

Custom software addresses problems that are unique to each business. From planning to post-production, we identify each development point to create software deliver top-notch performance and reinforce our brand identity.

### Case Study

Client: Resonant Education

`Resonant Education` is a survey platform. What makes them stand out is their unique ability to design surveys that measure the metrics that matter -- the type of surveys that answer the questions behind the questions.

`Resonant Education` needed a software platform that is robust to acquire and process data at a new level of efficiency. They also needed the platform to be stable and fluid to make data gathering a seamless experience for end users.

Our development specialists implemented back-end and front-end solutions that meet exactly the experience that `Resonant Education` wants for its users. We achieved this by engaging them through the whole software life cycle -- from consulting to release; and in the coding and project management that happen in between.
