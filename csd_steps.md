### Planning
We'll discuss what problem you are trying to solve or goals that you want to reach.

### Team selection 
We'll recommend the right people. Then you'll handpick the best candidates.

### Project Design
The developers are briefed about the nature and goals of the project. This is also your chance to meet and greet the people you'll be collaborating with. A project manager will ensure meaningful collaboration. 

### Develop
Our developers start writing code. This is when planning and design are converted into meaningful computer instructions that the end users can eventually benefit from. 

### Scrum
A project manager checks in with your team daily. Everyday, we compare progress against timeline; and identify challenges where they exist.

### Sprint plan
Every week, we review the progress. We rethink our approach and make changes where needed. 

### Test
Every feature matters -- we make sure they all work. We do automated testing where applicable; and manual testing where needed. 

### Deliver
Delivery is a continuous process. We bring valuable feature and software early to end users in order to create massive rooms for improvement. Delivery is not a static stage -- but a fluid state constantly reshaped by user feedback. 

### Post-launch
We analye user experience. We make sure the checkboxes in our goals lists are ticked.

### Update
The tech landscape constantly changes. We push your brand to where it matters -- at the forefront.
