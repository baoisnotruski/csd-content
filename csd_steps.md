### Team selection 
We'll recommend the right people. Then you'll handpick the best candidates.

### Project Design
The developers are briefed about the nature and goals of the project. This is also your chance to meet and greet the people you'll be collaborating with. A project manager will ensure meaningful collaboration.

### Post-launch
We analye user experience. We make sure the checkboxes in our goals lists are ticked.
