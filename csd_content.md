Web design is storytelling using images, layout, and text. The goal of the narrative is to turn a page view into conversion. Our creative team is a mixture of UX designers, editors, and content strategists whose responsibility includes conceptualizing the project to the refinement of user experience after launch.

### The Challenge
The main challenges of creating a modern website are fast load times, security, and usability. Additionally, the most important metric is also the hardest to quantify: user experience.

### The Solution
The solution is to create a design that looks good and runs on high-quality code. Quality code means better performance and faster load times. The craft of design -- put together by UX specialists and content strategists -- is built upon sound software architecture.
We constantly compare our portfolio and architecture with current design trends to keep up with the fine points that make quality user experience.

### eCommerce
Optimize for business success by building your own eCommerce site.

## New Window

### Overview
We have built web platforms to help business owners overcome the limitations of a physical store. These limitations include location, operation time, and overhead costs of a brick-and-mortar store. But selling online does come with challenges.
### Challenge
On the user interface side, an eCommerce website should have search functionality, responsive designs, and high-quality images. To increase the likelihood of sales, new and repeat, a few features like user-generated reviews, related items, and social proof should be present as well. All of these should be combined with security features and seamless, multi-option payment processes.
eCommerce websites require the most features. The challenge is to create a winning website or app that has all these features while maintaining a smooth and intuitive feel of the online shopping process.

### Solution
We combine creativity, clean architecture, good code, and analytical insights to implement a winning sales platform that is robust under the hood and pleasant to use.

### The Challenge
The future of mobile apps: simple interface, multiple functionalities, and low learning curves. The challenge is to bring all these seemingly conflicting elements together. How does one design a mobile app that provides users with all the functionalities they need while keeping the layout intuitive?

### The Solution
We combine front-end and back-end technologies to design the user experience (UX). UX is something that can be defined in every quality line of code and each choice of pixel combination. We bring together disciplined code architecture, innovative technology, and customer feedback. We create and redesign products to meet new market concepts and customer needs.

### Manual Testing

### Overview
Testing is putting the final touch to what we do. We explore the good, the bad, and the best of what we do. Our quality assurance engineers bring their tools and know-how so that the work we do reaches our benchmarks of excellence.

### Challenge
User experience is central to our testing. The feel of a website, although barely quantifiable, is essential to how users interact with a website. Additionally, ease of use and navigation are other factors that are beyond the scope of automated testing.

### Solution
Adding a human touch to quality tests ensures that your web app or website is pleasing to your intended audience -- humans. Our quality analysts go beyond understanding the product. We bring our understanding of business models and target audiences to create a picture of the product we all can be proud of.

# Automated Testing

### The Challenge
Quality specialists face bigger challenges in the time of a fast-changing software landscape, cross-platform development, big data, and microservices. The nature and volume of test scenarios are becoming harder to cover. Improvements in software development make it faster for QA tools to become obsolete.
### The Solution
Our quality specialists understand the business model of each of our clients. This allows us to create ideal testing suites. We then implement automated testing to maximize development team scaling. Integrating automated testing saves thousands of human hours in the life cycle of software. This means immense savings in terms of money and time.

### Project Management

### Overview
Tasks and deadlines are loose ends that come together in sync under our project management frameworks. Our agile project managers facilitate frictionless collaboration between developers, QAs, content specialists, and clients.

### The Challenge
Breaking down goals into manageable tasks can consume time and energy. Additionally, business challenges can present themselves as problems that are difficult to identify and interpret.

### The Solution
Isolating the problems into smaller components make it possible for multiple people to work on the same simultaneously. This is the nature of collaboration -- brilliant minds that perform unique tasks towards a common trajectory. Project management is the link that brings together talent, time, and goals into a bigger whole that function harmoniously.

# Big Data & Machine Learning
Organize your data for effective visualization and analysis.
# New Window
### Overview
We have been taking the steps to combine our experiences and expertise with big data. Being able to use massive chunks of information gives us the ability to make smarter decisions and better-informed design thinking.

### The challenge
Online data is massive. The first challenge is to build or find tools that make data collection efficient -- making machines do stuff that machines should do.
Big data, by its nature, is unstructured. The next challenge is to turn massive amounts of information into meaningful insights: insights that define where we put headers on a web page, what colors we want to use for mobile apps, and where we put the purchase button. The small decisions that we make are informed by big data.

### The solution
The challenges we encounter define pathways to the solutions we make. We use big data to create code so that the time users spend on the mobile and web apps that we build become meaningful experiences.
We utilize tools for large-scale data processing to distill meaningful insights. This allows us to take on experimental projects as if we have already been there before.
