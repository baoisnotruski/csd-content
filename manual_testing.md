Manual testing is when we put our design and code under the meticulous microscope of our experienced quality specialists. We explore the good, the bad, and the best of what we do. Our quality specialists bring their tools and know-how so that the work we do reaches our benchmarks of excellence.

### Challenge

User experience is central to our testing. The feel of a website, although barely quantifiable, is essential to how users interact with a website. Additionally, ease of use and navigation are other factors that are beyond the scope of automated testing. 

### Solution

Adding human touch to quality tests ensures that your web app or website are pleasing to your intended audience -- humans. Our quality analysts go beyond understanding the product. We bring our understanding of business models and target audiences to create products that represent the values we aspire to as a brand.
